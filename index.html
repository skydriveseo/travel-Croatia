<p>Dubrovnik and Split are popular tourist destinations, but these cities can often be crowded, overworked, and lack a feeling of discovery, especially at the height of the summer. Fortunately, Croatia boasts over 1,200 islands where you may get away, as well as undiscovered coastal villages, and a spectacular interior that includes picture-perfect pastoral vistas and huge mountains wherein wildlife roams. Thus, <a href="https://adventurescroatia.com"><strong>travel Croatia</strong></a> offers much more than just popular tourist attractions.</p>

<li>
<h3>Gorski Kotar</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the fact that Croatia's coastline may be its main tourist and local lure, the epidemic has heightened people's love for the vast outdoors.Adventures Croatia suggests taking a look at Gorski Kotar, Croatia's version of Switzerland. It is a wooded mountain habitat south of the region Zagreb just on route to the Kvarner shore. It is located in this lush area for city inhabitants looking for a small patch of uninhabited nature. The number of luxurious lodges as well as cabins that you may rent has lately increased in Gorski Kotar, which again is home to the threatened Eurasian wolves, lynx, as well as bears in the Risnjak National Park, such as the majestic Casa Nube as well as the adorable Gorska Bajka. It has excellent connections to Zagreb, the Croatian capital. From that, it takes just under two hours to drive there.

<h3>Sibenik</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This beach city in the middle of Dalmatia receives little attention from tourists since Split, which is an hour towards the south, and Dubrovnik, of course, get more attention. They are losing out on a true maritime treasure, one of just a few places in the world boasting two UNESCO-listed World Heritage Sites: the Venetian-era St Nicholas Fortress on an islet adjacent to the old town, and the dome-shaped St. James Cathedral, built completely of stone from 1431 and 1535. Ibenik also has several charming accommodation options, the newest of that which is the heritage hotel Armerun, which just started on the seafront steps from the chapel in the summer of 2021. Additionally, Sibenik is home to Pelegrini, a Michelin-starred destination eatery where the owner, as well as chef Rudi tefan, creates delectable dishes.</p>
<ul class="bulletic">
<li>
<h3>Pag Island</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Going to Pag is comparable to going to the moon. This island is well-known for its moonlike scenery and wild parties that invade Zre's beaches in the summer. Bokinac, one of Croatia's most charming family-run guesthouses, is located on the island merely inland from the seaside village of Novalja. In addition to having an award-winning wine shop and a Michelin-starred eatery, the hotel is housed in a beautifully redeveloped stone building encircled by olive groves as well as vineyards.</p>
<ul class="bulletic">
<li>
<h3>Silba &amp; Zlarin Islands</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Croatian creatives retreat to these islands throughout the summer, and you'll notice a unique bohemian, alternative atmosphere there. You can find some nice private accommodations, but if you want the finest, book well in advance since it sells out quickly. Don't skip Konoba Alavija's sunset seafood feast on Silba, which features freshly caught fish. Families should visit both islands since the kids may play carefree as well as barefoot around.</p>
<p>Thus, keep these places in mind while drafting your itinerary for Croatia.</p>
